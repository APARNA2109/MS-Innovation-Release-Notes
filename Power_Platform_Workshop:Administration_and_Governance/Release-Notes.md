### Release Date: 2025-05-26

- **Change**: The lab was originally tested a year ago, so this involved a complete re-onboarding. While the core content remained unchanged, extensive updates were made to reflect the latest UI enhancements, including revising nearly all screenshots to align with the current user experience.
  
- **Testing Date**: 2025-05-26

## Infrastructure Changes

### LAB 02
  
  - **Exercises 3 to 6** were moved to HOL 6 because they depended on the app being created in Power Platform and data appearing in Power BI, which required the **CoE Starter Kit** to be installed and set up first. Since it takes around 2–3 hours for the data to fully reflect after setup, we shifted these exercises to the end to avoid delays and ensure a smoother lab flow.
  - Included new exercise 3 that includes 2 tasks with proper steps and screenshots for setting up the inventory component of the **CoE Starter Kit**.
  - **Exercise 7** was removed because the template used was outdated, and the overall lab duration was becoming too long.

### LAB 03

  - **Exercise 3** was removed and moved to **HOL 6** for the same reason as Lab 2—it depends on the CoE Starter Kit. Since the setup takes 2–3 hours for the data to fully reflect, shifting these exercises to the end helps avoid delays and ensures a smoother lab experience.

### LAB 05

  - Found UI updates in Teams app, updates the UI according to the changes
  - Merged the earlier exercises from HOL 6 into Lab 05 since both were performed within the Teams app, making the flow more cohesive and also due to the reason that we have moved multiple exercises from HOL 2 and 3 to HOL 6 now.

#### LAB 06

  - Now LAB 06 contains the removed exercises from HOL 2 and HOL 3

## Content Changes

  - Have added new Exercise for **CoE Starter Kit** set up in HOL 2 Exercise 3
  

## Screenshot Updates

- **Change**: Updated almost all the screenshots for the whole lab to reflect the latest UI changes in the Power Platform and Teams app

## Validation

Removed the lab validation from **HOL 3 Exercise 2** based on a recommendation from the Engineering team, as the specific validation API is no longer supported.

## Testing Notes

- **Test Validation Summary**: Validated the lab guide steps, updated the content to reflect the latest UI changes, reorganized exercises for better alignment with the overall lab flow, and added a new exercise based on updated requirements.
